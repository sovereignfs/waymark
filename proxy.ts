/**
 * **Every page is sent with a Content-Security-Policy** with a nonce of its own (`src/security/csp.ts`), so every page is rendered per request, the
 * landing page too. The proxy makes the nonce and puts the policy on the request, where Next reads it and puts the nonce on the scripts and styles
 * it makes, and the layout puts it on the theme script (`x-nonce`); it puts the policy on the response too, where the browser enforces it. An API's
 * answer is data, with no page to protect, so it gets only the headers every response has (`next.config.ts`).
 *
 * It keeps the Edge discipline: no Node built-ins and no database. It only looks at the request, so a session is for the page to check, and a
 * proxy is never the only thing standing in the way (DESIGN.md §5.2). Copied from Tusk; its sign-in and Home rewrites join with 2.1 and 2.2.
 *
 * The service worker keeps one page, `/shell` (1.11), and answers an address with it when there is no network. It is kept with the headers it was
 * sent with, so the nonce in its policy is the nonce on its scripts: it needs no fresh one.
